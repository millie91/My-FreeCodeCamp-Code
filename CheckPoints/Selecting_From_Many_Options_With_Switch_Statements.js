/* If you have many options to choose from, use a switch statement. A switch statement tests a value and can have many case statements which defines various possible values. Statements are executed from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is a pseudocode example:

switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;
  case value2:
    statement2;
    break;
...
  case valueN:
    statementN;
    break;
}
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

Instructions
Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
1 - "alpha"
2 - "beta"
3 - "gamma"
4 - "delta"

caseInSwitch(1) should have a value of "alpha"
caseInSwitch(2) should have a value of "beta"
caseInSwitch(3) should have a value of "gamma"
caseInSwitch(4) should have a value of "delta"
You should not use any if or else statements
You should have at least 3 break statements
