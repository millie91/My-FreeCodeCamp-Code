/* Another use of bracket notation on objects is to use a variable to access a property. This can be very useful for iterating through lists of the object properties or for doing the lookup.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

var someProp = "propName";
var myObj = {
  propName: "Some Value"
}
myObj[someProp]; // "Some Value"
Here is one more:

var myDog = "Hunter";
var dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",
  Hunter: "Doberman",
  Snoopie: "Beagle"
}
var breed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(breed);// "Doberman"
Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name

Instructions
Use the playerNumber variable to lookup player 16 in testObj using bracket notation.

playerNumber should be a number
The variable player should be a string
The value of player should be "Montana"
You should use bracket notation to access testObj
You should be using the variable playerNumber in your bracket notation
