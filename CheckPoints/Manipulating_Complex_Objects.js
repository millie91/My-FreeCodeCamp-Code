/* Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.

Here's an example of a complex data structure:

var ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP" ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested "formats" array. If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array.

Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, "artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of "artist" and a value of "Daft Punk".

JavaScript Object Notation or JSON is a related data interchange format used to store data.

{
  "artist": "Daft Punk",
  "title": "Homework",
  "release_year": 1997,
  "formats": [ 
    "CD",
    "Cassette",
    "LP"
  ],
  "gold": true
}
Note
You will need to place a comma after every object in the array, unless it is the last object in the array.

Instructions
Add a new album to the myMusic array. Add artist and title strings, release_year number, and a formats array of strings.

myMusic should be an array
myMusic should have at least two elements
myMusic[1] should be an object
myMusic[1] should have at least 4 properties
myMusic[1] should contain an artist property which is a string
myMusic[1] should contain a title property which is a string
myMusic[1] should contain a release_year property which is a number
myMusic[1] should contain a formats property which is an array
